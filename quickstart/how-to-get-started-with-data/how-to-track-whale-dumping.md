# Track Whale Dumping

Entities who hold a vast number of coins of a particular cryptocurrency are known as whales that could be institutions or individuals in the crypto market. 

As the concentration of wealth, Whales can be a problem that creates volatility or decreases liquidity for a specific cryptocurrency. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if whales put massive sell orders on the market to sell coins for currency, the panic selling they generated could put downward pressure on the price. 
{% endhint %}

There are some suggested indicators to monitor whale dumping on the blockchain:

## Top Balance

The top balance pie chart in Candlestick is helpful as it can show you whether there are just a few wallets holding most of the supply of a particular coin or token. 

If a few holders heavily concentrate the supply of coins, there would be a considerable risk that one of these whales could start to sell, which would dump the price.

## Top Transactions

Candlestick provides this indicator to estimate the large on-chain transaction to help you check the possibility of whale dumping. 

When you figure out a big deal is happening from a personal wallet address to an [exchange,](www.cctv.com) this might mean the whale who sent a specific cryptocurrency wants to sell it.

## Active Addresses

Another indicator that could benefit the whale tracker is the active addresses. Suppose there are wallet-exchange transactions from an ancient whale address sleeping for ages. In that case, it could be a signal suggested that the price of a particular cryptocurrency has achieved a high level that even the hardcore holders are awaked for selling.
